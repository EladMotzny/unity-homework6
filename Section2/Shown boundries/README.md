# Shown Boundaries

first we add to each of the wall objects- box collider 2D component.
And then we add Rigidbody 2D component, and change the 'body type' to "Kinematic" so the walls will be stiff.

Next we add to the spaceship a circle collider component and adjust the radius to be the exact size of the spaceship.
Finally we add the Rigidbody 2D component to the spaceship and set the gravity to 0.
